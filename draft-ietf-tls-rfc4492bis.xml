    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t> Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is emerging as an attractive public-key cryptosystem, in particular for 
        mobile (i.e., wireless) environments.  Compared to currently prevalent cryptosystems such as RSA, ECC offers 
        equivalent security with smaller key sizes.  This is illustrated in the following table, based on 
        <xref target="Lenstra_Verheul"/>, which gives approximate comparable key sizes for symmetric- and 
        asymmetric-key cryptosystems based on the best-known algorithms for attacking them.</t>

      </texttable>
      <t> Smaller key sizes result in savings for power, memory, bandwidth, and computational cost that make ECC 
        especially attractive for constrained environments.</t>
      <t> This document describes additions to TLS to support ECC, applicable to TLS versions 1.0 
        <xref target="RFC2246"/>, 1.1 <xref target="RFC4346"/>, and 1.2 <xref target="RFC5246"/>.  The use of ECC in 
        TLS 1.3 is defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-tls13" />, and is explicitly out of scope for this document. 
        In particular, this document defines:<list style="symbols">
        <t> the use of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement scheme with ephemeral keys to establish the 
          TLS premaster secret, and</t>
        <t>the use of ECDSA certificates for authentication of TLS peers.</t></list></t>
      <t> The remainder of this document is organized as follows. <xref target="ecdh"/> provides an overview of 
        ECC-based key exchange algorithms for TLS. <xref target="clientauth"/> describes the use of ECC certificates 
        for client authentication.  TLS extensions that allow a client to negotiate the use of specific curves and 
        point formats are presented in <xref target="tlsext"/>. <xref target="structs"/> specifies various data 
        structures needed for an ECC-based handshake, their encoding in TLS messages, and the processing of those 
        messages.  <xref target="suites"/> defines ECC-based cipher suites and identifies a small subset of these 
        as recommended for all implementations of this specification. <xref target="sec"/> discusses security 
        considerations. <xref target="iana"/> describes IANA considerations for the name spaces created by this 
        document's predecessor. <xref target="ack" /> gives acknowledgements. <xref target="rfc4492diff" /> 
        provides differences from <xref target="RFC4492" />, the document that this one replaces.</t>
      <t> Implementation of this specification requires familiarity with TLS, TLS extensions 
        <xref target="RFC4366" />, and ECC (TBD: reference Wikipedia here?).</t>

    <section anchor="ecdh" title="Key Exchange Algorithm">
      <t> This document defines three new ECC-based key exchange algorithms for TLS.  All of them use Ephemeral 
        ECDH (ECDHE) to compute the TLS premaster secret, and they differ only in the mechanism (if any) used to 
        authenticate them.  The derivation of the TLS master secret from the premaster secret and the subsequent 
        generation of bulk encryption/MAC keys and initialization vectors is independent of the key exchange 
        algorithm and not impacted by the introduction of ECC.</t>
      <t> The table below summarizes the new key exchange algorithms, which mimic DHE_DSS, DHE_RSA, and DH_anon, 
        respectively.</t>
      <texttable anchor="tbl2" title="ECC Key Exchange Algorithms">
        <ttcol align="left">Algorithm</ttcol>
        <ttcol align="left">Description</ttcol>

        <c>ECDH_anon</c><c>Anonymous ECDH, no signatures.</c>
      </texttable>
      <t> The ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA key exchange mechanisms provide forward secrecy.  With ECDHE_RSA, a server 
        can reuse its existing RSA certificate and easily comply with a constrained client's elliptic curve p
        references (see <xref target="tlsext"/>).  However, the computational cost incurred by a server is higher 
        for ECDHE_RSA than for the traditional RSA key exchange, which does not provide forward secrecy.</t>
      <t> The anonymous key exchange algorithm does not provide authentication of the server or the client.  Like 
        other anonymous TLS key exchanges, it is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. Implementations of this 
        algorithm SHOULD provide authentication by other means.</t>
      <t> Note that there is no structural difference between ECDH and ECDSA keys.  A certificate issuer may use 
        X.509 v3 keyUsage and extendedKeyUsage extensions to restrict the use of an ECC public key to certain 
        computations.  This document refers to an ECC key as ECDH-capable if its use in ECDH is permitted.  
        ECDSA-capable is defined similarly. <figure>

      <t> Figure 1 shows all messages involved in the TLS key establishment protocol (aka full handshake).  The 
        addition of ECC has direct impact only on the ClientHello, the ServerHello, the server's Certificate 
        message, the ServerKeyExchange, the ClientKeyExchange, the CertificateRequest, the client's Certificate 
        message, and the CertificateVerify.  Next, we describe the ECC key exchange algorithm in greater detail 
        in terms of the content and processing of these messages.  For ease of exposition, we defer discussion of 
        client authentication and associated messages (identified with a + in Figure 1) until 
        <xref target="clientauth" /> and of the optional ECC-specific extensions (which impact the Hello messages) 
        until <xref target="tlsext" />.</t>
      <section anchor="ecdhe_ecdsa" title="ECDHE_ECDSA">
        <t> In ECDHE_ECDSA, the server's certificate MUST contain an ECDSA-capable public key and be signed with 
          ECDSA.</t>
        <t> The server sends its ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification of the corresponding curve in the 
          ServerKeyExchange message.  These parameters MUST be signed with ECDSA using the private key corresponding 
          to the public key in the server's Certificate.</t>
        <t> The client generates an ECDH key pair on the same curve as the server's ephemeral ECDH key and sends its 
          public key in the ClientKeyExchange message.</t>

        <t> This key exchange algorithm is the same as ECDHE_ECDSA except that the server's certificate MUST contain 
          an RSA public key authorized for signing, and that the signature in the ServerKeyExchange message must be 
          computed with the corresponding RSA private key.  The server certificate MUST be signed with RSA.</t>

        <t> In ECDH_anon, the server's Certificate, the CertificateRequest, the client's Certificate, and the 
          CertificateVerify messages MUST NOT be sent.</t>
        <t> The server MUST send an ephemeral ECDH public key and a specification of the corresponding curve in

        <t> Note that while the ECDHE_ECDSA and ECDHE_RSA key exchange algorithms require the server's certificate 
          to be signed with a particular signature scheme, this specification (following the similar cases of 
          DHE_DSS, and DHE_RSA in the TLS base documents) does not impose restrictions on signature schemes used 
          elsewhere in the certificate chain.  (Often such restrictions will be useful, and it is expected that this 
          will be taken into account in certification authorities' signing practices.  However, such restrictions are 
          not strictly required in general: Even if it is beyond the capabilities of a client to completely validate 
          a given chain, the client may be able to validate the server's certificate by relying on a trusted 
          certification authority whose certificate appears as one of the intermediate certificates in the chain.)</t>

    <section anchor="clientauth" title="Client Authentication">
      <t> This document defines a client authentication mechanism, named after the type of client certificate 
        involved: ECDSA_sign.  The ECDSA_sign mechanism is usable with any of the non-anonymous ECC key exchange 
        algorithms described in <xref target="ecdh"/> as well as other non-anonymous (non-ECC) key exchange 
        algorithms defined in TLS.</t>
      <t> The server can request ECC-based client authentication by including this certificate type in its 
        CertificateRequest message. The client must check if it possesses a certificate appropriate for the method 
        suggested by the server and is willing to use it for authentication.</t>
      <t> If these conditions are not met, the client should send a client Certificate message containing no 
        certificates.  In this case, the ClientKeyExchange should be sent as described in <xref target="ecdh"/>, and 
        the CertificateVerify should not be sent.  If the server requires client authentication, it may respond with 
        a fatal handshake failure alert.</t>
      <t> If the client has an appropriate certificate and is willing to use it for authentication, it must send 
        that certificate in the client's Certificate message (as per <xref target="client_cert"/>) and prove 
        possession of the private key corresponding to the certified key.  The process of determining an 
        appropriate certificate and proving possession is different for each authentication mechanism and 
        described below.</t>
      <t> NOTE: It is permissible for a server to request (and the client to send) a client certificate of a 
        different type than the server certificate.</t>
      <section anchor="ecdsa_sign" title="ECDSA_sign">
        <t> To use this authentication mechanism, the client MUST possess a certificate containing an ECDSA-capable 
          public key and signed with ECDSA.</t>
        <t> The client proves possession of the private key corresponding to the certified key by including a 
          signature in the CertificateVerify message as described in <xref target="cert_verify"/>.</t>

    </section>
    <section anchor="tlsext" title="TLS Extensions for ECC">
      <t> Two new TLS extensions are defined in this specification: (i) the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, 
        and (ii) the Supported Point Formats Extension.  These allow negotiating the use of specific curves and 
        point formats (e.g., compressed vs. uncompressed, respectively) during a handshake starting a new session.  
        These extensions are especially relevant for constrained clients that may only support a limited number of 
        curves or point formats.  They follow the general approach outlined in <xref target="RFC4366"/>; message 
        details are specified in <xref target="structs"/>.  The client enumerates the curves it supports and the 
        point formats it can parse by including the appropriate extensions in its ClientHello message.  The server 
        similarly enumerates the point formats it can parse by including an extension in its ServerHello message.</t>
      <t> A TLS client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello message SHOULD include these extensions.  
        Servers implementing ECC cipher suites MUST support these extensions, and when a client uses these 
        extensions, servers MUST NOT negotiate the use of an ECC cipher suite unless they can complete the 
        handshake while respecting the choice of curves and compression techniques specified by the client. 
        This eliminates the possibility that a negotiated ECC handshake will be subsequently aborted due to a 
        client's inability to deal with the server's EC key.</t>
      <t> The client MUST NOT include these extensions in the ClientHello message if it does not propose any ECC 
        cipher suites.  A client that proposes ECC cipher suites may choose not to include these extensions.  In 
        this case, the server is free to choose any one of the elliptic curves or point formats listed in 
        <xref target="structs"/>.  That section also describes the structure and processing of these extensions 
        in greater detail.</t>
      <t> In the case of session resumption, the server simply ignores the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and 
        the Supported Point Formats Extension appearing in the current ClientHello message. These extensions only 
        play a role during handshakes negotiating a new session.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="structs" title="Data Structures and Computations">
      <t> This section specifies the data structures and computations used by ECC-based key mechanisms specified 
        in the previous three sections.  The presentation language used here is the same as that used in TLS.  
        Since this specification extends TLS, these descriptions should be merged with those in the TLS specification 
        and any others that extend TLS.  This means that enum types may not specify all possible values, and 
        structures with multiple formats chosen with a select() clause may not indicate all possible cases.</t>
      <section anchor="ch_extensions" title="Client Hello Extensions">
        <t> This section specifies two TLS extensions that can be included with the ClientHello message as described 
          in <xref target="RFC4366"/>, the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and the Supported Point Formats 
          Extension.</t>
        <t> When these extensions are sent:</t>
        <t> The extensions SHOULD be sent along with any ClientHello message that proposes ECC cipher suites.</t>
        <t> Meaning of these extensions:</t>
        <t> These extensions allow a client to enumerate the elliptic curves it supports and/or the point formats 
          it can parse.</t>
        <t> Structure of these extensions:</t>
        <t> The general structure of TLS extensions is described in <xref target="RFC4366"/>, and this specification 
          adds two new types to ExtensionType.<figure><artwork><![CDATA[

            curves supported by the client.  For this extension, the opaque extension_data field contains 
            EllipticCurveList.  See <xref target="supp_ec_ext"/> for details.</t>
          <t hangText="ec_point_formats (Supported Point Formats Extension):"> Indicates the set of point formats

        <t> Actions of the sender:</t>
        <t> A client that proposes ECC cipher suites in its ClientHello message appends these extensions (along 
          with any others), enumerating the curves it supports and the point formats it can parse.  Clients SHOULD 
          send both the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension and the Supported Point Formats Extension.  If the 
          Supported Point Formats Extension is indeed sent, it MUST contain the value 0 (uncompressed) as one of the 
          items in the list of point formats.</t>
        <t> Actions of the receiver:</t>
        <t> A server that receives a ClientHello containing one or both of these extensions MUST use the client's 
          enumerated capabilities to guide its selection of an appropriate cipher suite.  One of the proposed ECC 
          cipher suites must be negotiated only if the server can successfully complete the handshake while using 
          the curves and point formats supported by the client (cf. <xref target="server_cert"/> and 
          <xref target="ske"/>).</t>
        <t> NOTE: A server participating in an ECDHE-ECDSA key exchange may use different curves for (i) the ECDSA 
          key in its certificate, and (ii) the ephemeral ECDH key in the ServerKeyExchange message.  The server must 
          consider the extensions in both cases.</t>
        <t> If a server does not understand the Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, does not understand the 
          Supported Point Formats Extension, or is unable to complete the ECC handshake while restricting itself 
          to the enumerated curves and point formats, it MUST NOT negotiate the use of an ECC cipher suite.  
          Depending on what other cipher suites are proposed by the client and supported by the server, this may 
          result in a fatal handshake failure alert due to the lack of common cipher suites.</t>
        <section anchor="supp_ec_ext" title="Supported Elliptic Curves Extension">

            deprecates the explicit curves with identifiers 0xFF01 and 0xFF02. This leaves only the following:</t>

          <t> Three point formats were included in the definition of ECPointFormat above. This specification

            uncompressed format for all of their supported curves, and MUST support no other formats for curves
            defined in this specification. For backwards compatibility purposes, the point format list extension
            MUST still be included, and contain exactly one value: the uncomptessed point format (0).</t>

            new value assignments are added.</t>

      <section anchor="serverhello_ext" title="Server Hello Extension">
        <t> This section specifies a TLS extension that can be included with the ServerHello message as described 
          in <xref target="RFC4366"/>, the Supported Point Formats Extension.</t>
        <t> When this extension is sent:</t>
        <t> The Supported Point Formats Extension is included in a ServerHello message in response to a ClientHello 
          message containing the Supported Point Formats Extension when negotiating an ECC cipher suite.</t>
        <t> Meaning of this extension:</t>
        <t> This extension allows a server to enumerate the point formats it can parse (for the curve that will appear 
          in its ServerKeyExchange message when using the ECDHE_ECDSA, ECDHE_RSA, or ECDH_anon key exchange algorithm.</t>
        <t> Structure of this extension:</t>
        <t> The server's Supported Point Formats Extension has the same structure as the client's Supported Point 
          Formats Extension (see <xref target="supp_pf_ext"/>).  Items in ec_point_format_list here are ordered 
          according to the server's preference (favorite choice first).  Note that the server may include items that 
          were not found in the client's list (e.g., the server may prefer to receive points in compressed format 
          even when a client cannot parse this format: the same client may nevertheless be capable of outputting 
          points in compressed format).</t>
        <t> Actions of the sender:</t>
        <t> A server that selects an ECC cipher suite in response to a ClientHello message including a Supported 
          Point Formats Extension appends this extension (along with others) to its ServerHello message, enumerating 
          the point formats it can parse.  The Supported Point Formats Extension, when used, MUST contain the value 0 
          (uncompressed) as one of the items in the list of point formats.</t>
        <t> Actions of the receiver:</t>
        <t> A client that receives a ServerHello message containing a Supported Point Formats Extension MUST respect 
          the server's choice of point formats during the handshake (cf. <xref target="client_cert"/> and 
          <xref target="cke"/>).  If no Supported Point Formats Extension is received with the ServerHello, this is 
          equivalent to an extension allowing only the uncompressed point format.</t>

        <t> This message is used to authentically convey the server's static public key to the client.  The following 
          table shows the server certificate type appropriate for each key exchange algorithm.  ECC public keys MUST 
          be encoded in certificates as described in <xref target="eccerts"/>.</t>

      <t> Structure of this message:</t>
      <t> Identical to the TLS Certificate format.</t>
      <t> Actions of the sender:</t>
      <t> The server constructs an appropriate certificate chain and conveys it to the client in the Certificate 
        message.  If the client has used a Supported Elliptic Curves Extension, the public key in the server's 
        certificate MUST respect the client's choice of elliptic curves; in particular, the public key MUST employ 
        a named curve (not the same curve as an explicit curve) unless the client has indicated support for 
        explicit curves of the appropriate type.  If the client has used a Supported Point Formats Extension, both 
        the server's public key point and (in the case of an explicit curve) the curve's base point MUST respect 
        the client's choice of point formats.  (A server that cannot satisfy these requirements MUST NOT choose 
        an ECC cipher suite in its ServerHello message.)</t>
      <t> Actions of the receiver:</t>
      <t> The client validates the certificate chain, extracts the server's public key, and checks that the key 
        type is appropriate for the negotiated key exchange algorithm.  (A possible reason for a fatal handshake 
        failure is that the client's capabilities for handling elliptic curves and point formats are exceeded; 
        cf. <xref target="ch_extensions"/>.)</t>

        <t> When this message is sent:</t>
        <t> This message is sent when the client sends a client certificate containing a public key usable for 
          digital signatures, e.g., when the client is authenticated using the ECDSA_sign mechanism.</t>
        <t> Meaning of the message:</t>
        <t> This message contains a signature that proves possession of the private key corresponding to the public 
          key in the client's Certificate message.</t>
        <t> Structure of this message:</t>
        <t> The TLS CertificateVerify message and the underlying Signature type are defined in the TLS base 
          specifications, and the latter is extended here in <xref target="ske"/>.  For the ecdsa case, the signature 
          field in the CertificateVerify message contains an ECDSA signature computed over handshake messages 
          exchanged so far, exactly similar to CertificateVerify with other signing algorithms:<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
        CertificateVerify.signature.sha_hash
            SHA(handshake_messages);
]]></artwork></figure></t>
        <t> ECDSA signatures are computed as described in <xref target="alg_computes"/>, and SHA in the above 
          template for sha_hash accordingly may denote a hash algorithm other than SHA-1.  As per ANSI X9.62, an 
          ECDSA signature consists of a pair of integers, r and s.  The digitally-signed element is encoded as an 
          opaque vector &lt;0..2^16-1&gt;, the contents of which are the DER encoding <xref target="CCITT.X690"/> 
          corresponding to the following ASN.1 notation <xref target="CCITT.X680"/>.<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
        Ecdsa-Sig-Value ::= SEQUENCE {
            r       INTEGER,

        }
]]></artwork></figure></t>
        <t> Actions of the sender:</t>
        <t> The client computes its signature over all handshake messages sent or received starting at client hello 
          and up to but not including this message.  It uses the private key corresponding to its certified public 
          key to compute the signature, which is conveyed in the format defined above.</t>
        <t> Actions of the receiver:</t>
        <t> The server extracts the client's signature from the CertificateVerify message, and verifies the 
          signature using the public key it received in the client's Certificate message.</t>

        <t> All ECDH calculations (including parameter and key generation as well as the shared secret calculation) 
          are performed according to <xref target="IEEE.P1363.1998"/> using the ECKAS-DH1 scheme with the identity 
          map as key derivation function (KDF), so that the premaster secret is the x-coordinate of the ECDH shared 
          secret elliptic curve point represented as an octet string.  Note that this octet string (Z in IEEE 1363 
          terminology) as output by FE2OSP, the Field Element to Octet String Conversion Primitive, has constant 
          length for any given field; leading zeros found in this octet string MUST NOT be truncated.</t>
        <t> (Note that this use of the identity KDF is a technicality.  The complete picture is that ECDH is 
          employed with a non-trivial KDF because TLS does not directly use the premaster secret for anything other 
          than for computing the master secret.  In TLS 1.0 and 1.1, this means that the MD5- and SHA-1-based TLS 
          PRF serves as a KDF; in TLS 1.2 the KDF is determined by ciphersuite; it is conceivable that future TLS 
          versions or new TLS extensions introduced in the future may vary this computation.)</t>
        <t> All ECDSA computations MUST be performed according to ANSI X9.62 or its successors.  Data to be 
          signed/verified is hashed, and the result run directly through the ECDSA algorithm with no additional 
          hashing.  The default hash function is SHA-1 <xref target="FIPS.180-2"/>, and sha_size (see 
          <xref target="ske"/> and <xref target="cert_verify"/>) is 20. However, an alternative hash function, such 
          as one of the new SHA hash functions specified in FIPS 180-2 <xref target="FIPS.180-2"/>, may be used instead.</t>
        <t> RFC 4492 anticipated the standardization of a mechanism for specifying the required hash function in the certificate,
        perhaps in the parameters field of the subjectPublicKeyInfo. Such standardization never took place, and as a result, 
        SHA-1 is used in TLS 1.1 and earlier. TLS 1.2 added a SignatureAndHashAlgorithm parameter to the DigitallySigned struct, 
        thus allowing agility in choosing the signature hash.</t>

    <section anchor="sec" title="Security Considerations">
      <t> Security issues are discussed throughout this memo.</t>
      <t> For TLS handshakes using ECC cipher suites, the security considerations in appendices D of all three TLS 
        base documemts apply accordingly.</t>
      <t> Security discussions specific to ECC can be found in <xref target="IEEE.P1363.1998"/> and 
        <xref target="ANSI.X9-62.2005"/>. One important issue that implementers and users must consider is elliptic 
        curve selection.  Guidance on selecting an appropriate elliptic curve size is given in Table 1.</t>
      <t> Beyond elliptic curve size, the main issue is elliptic curve structure.  As a general principle, it is 
        more conservative to use elliptic curves with as little algebraic structure as possible. Thus, random curves 
        are more conservative than special curves such as Koblitz curves, and curves over F_p with p random are more 
        conservative than curves over F_p with p of a special form (and curves over F_p with p random might be 
        considered more conservative than curves over F_2^m as there is no choice between multiple fields of similar 
        size for characteristic 2).  Note, however, that algebraic structure can also lead to implementation 
        efficiencies, and implementers and users may, therefore, need to balance conservatism against a need for 
        efficiency.  Concrete attacks are known against only very few special classes of curves, such as supersingular 
        curves, and these classes are excluded from the ECC standards that this document references 
        <xref target="IEEE.P1363.1998"/>, <xref target="ANSI.X9-62.2005"/>.</t>
      <t> Another issue is the potential for catastrophic failures when a single elliptic curve is widely used.  
        In this case, an attack on the elliptic curve might result in the compromise of a large number of keys.  
        Again, this concern may need to be balanced against efficiency and interoperability improvements associated 
        with widely-used curves. Substantial additional information on elliptic curve choice can be found in 
        <xref target="IEEE.P1363.1998"/>, <xref target="ANSI.X9-62.2005"/>, and <xref target="FIPS.186-4"/>.</t>
      <t> All of the key exchange algorithms defined in this document provide forward secrecy. Some of the 
        deprecated key exchange algorithms do not.</t>
